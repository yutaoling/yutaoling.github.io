Hi, This is Yutao LING. I'm an undergraduate student at [Qian Xuesen Honors College](https://bjb.xjtu.edu.cn), [School of Energy and Power Engineering](https://epe.xjtu.edu.cn), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn) from 2022 to 2026(estimated). I would pursue a PhD degree in [Shanghai Innovation Institute](https://www.sii.edu.cn), and [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn) since 2026, kindly guided by [Prof. Yanwei Fu](https://yanweifu.github.io).

I'm a new comer in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence, still getting familiar with the theories, the applications and the cultures. I have research experience in Energy and Power Engineering, and Material Science and Technology. I'm heading towards the computer vision and embodied intelligence. Wish me luck!
